My name is Jihan Lee, and I am a Senior undergraduate student at Emory University majoring in Economics/Computer Science. My passion lies at the intersection of data science and problem-solving, which is fueled by a strong foundation in economics, statistics, and computer science.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to jazz musics, taking photos with my film camera, and watching english football games (I'm a big fan of Man. United). I also love exploring different wines and whiskeys.
